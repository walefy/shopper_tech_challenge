Analyze this image of a gas or water meter. The meter may be analog or digital. Follow these steps to ensure the most accurate reading:

1. **Identify the Type of Meter**: Determine if the meter is analog or digital.
2. **Analog Meter Reading**:
  - **Dial Analysis**: Carefully read each dial, considering the direction and precise position of the pointer.
  - **Boundary Cases**: Pay special attention to pointers that are between numbers or very close to a boundary. If the pointer is between two numbers, use the lower number unless the pointer has clearly passed the higher number.
  - **Direction of Rotation**: Note the direction of rotation for each dial, as it may differ.
  - **Avoid Overestimation**: Ensure not to overestimate the reading if the pointer hasn't fully reached a number.
3. **Digital Meter Reading**:
  - **Clear Digits**: Ensure all digits are clearly read and transcribed accurately.
4. **Return Format**: Return only the numeric reading as a single string of digits, without any additional characters or spaces.

Ensure the reading is as accurate as possible, considering all the nuances of the meter type and pointer positions and return just the final value with digits.
